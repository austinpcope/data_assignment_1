				Humans' impacts on the climate are coming full circle. As global temperatures continue to rise due to fossil fuel emissions, a changing climate is contributing to more frequent and higher-intensity disasters. In 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA)'s National Centers for Environmental Information logged 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the United States, bringing a combined total of $95 billion in damages.  Though climate change influences global weather systems in complex ways, the impacts are becoming more clear as disasters like wildfire, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms and drought become frequent and intense.

					Hurricanes are becoming stronger as rising ocean temperatures cause more precipitation, stronger winds and rising sea levels that will affect costal areas' vulnerability to storms. More moisture in the air will create more rainfall during storms and warmer water will increase wind speed, leading to flooding and increased damages.

					Though thunderstorms are common and often benign, some can be dangerous. Warming ground surface temperatures can increase the amount of wind energy stored in the air, leading to increased rainfall and lightning, as well as more serious disasters like tornados, derechos, and supercells. Though scientists are still determining where and how often those impacts will occur, modeling shows a potential for increased thunderstorm frequency and intensity in the eastern United States as climate change continues.

					More intense drought and forest dieoffs have led to an increase in amount of dry fuels that can cause large-scale wildfires.  Warmer temperatures have also lengthened fire seasons in many parts of the U.S. and wildfires can impact large swatchs of forests, ecosystems, and human settlement. More frequent thunderstorms could also lead to more wildfire-causing lightning strikes, though long-term trends remain uncertain.

				<p> 
					Warmer winter temperatures are decreasing snowfall in regions that rely on snowmelt for water sources, leading to more intense droughts. Lower reflectivity from accumulated snow can also cause quicker surface warming, exacerbating drought. Climate change could also increase precipitation variability, leading to wider fluctuations between wet and dry weather. The southwestern portion of the United States has seen a decrease in annual precipitation over the past two decades, and that trend is expected to continue.

			Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions combined with other sustainable practices and technologies can help reduce humans' impacts on global climate systems. Though the near future may bring costlier and more frequent disasters, impacts to subsequent generations could be less if we make changes in our values, priorities and actions.
